abstract = {{Based on the previous literature about the random logistic and Gompertz models, the aim of this paper is to extend the investigations to the generalized logistic differential equation in the random setting. First, this is done by rigorously constructing its solution in two different ways, namely, the sample-path approach and the mean-square calculus. Secondly, the probability density function at each time instant is derived in two ways: by applying the random variable transformation technique and by solving the associated Liouville’s partial differential equation. It is also proved that both the stochastic solution and its density function converge, under specific conditions, to the corresponding solution and density function of the logistic and Gompertz models, respectively. The investigation finishes showing some examples, where a number of computational techniques are combined to construct reliable approximations of the probability density of the stochastic solution. In particular, we show, step-by-step, how our findings can be applied to a real-world problem.}},

abstract = {{This paper deals with the study, from a probabilistic point of view, of logistic-type differential equations with uncertainties. We assume that the initial condition is a random variable and the diffusion coefficient is a stochastic process. The main objective is to obtain the first probability density function, f 1(p, t), of the solution stochastic process, P(t, ω). To achieve this goal, first the diffusion coefficient is represented via a truncation of order N of the Karhunen–Loève expansion, and second, the Random Variable Transformation technique is applied. In this manner, approximations, say f 1 N ( p , t ) , of f 1(p, t) are constructed. Afterwards, we rigorously prove that f 1 N ( p , t ) ⟶ f 1 ( p , t ) as N → ∞ under mild conditions assumed on input data (initial condition and diffusion coefficient). Finally, three illustrative examples are shown.}},

abstract = {{ We describe the growth dynamics of a harvested fish population in a random environment using a stochastic differential equation logistic model, where the harvest term depends on a constant or a variable fishing effort. We consider revenues to be proportional to the yield and costs to be quadratic in terms of effort. We compare the optimal expected profit obtained with two types of harvesting policies, one based on variable effort, which is inapplicable, and the other based on a constant effort, which is applicable and sustainable. We answer two new questions: (a) What is the constant effort that optimizes the expected profit per unit time? (b) How do the two policies compare in terms of performance? We show that, in a realistic situation, there is only a slight reduction in profit when choosing the applicable constant effort policy instead of the inapplicable policy with variable effort.}},

abstract = {{We start by reviewing several results that have been obtained by the author concerning a general model of population growth in a randomly varying environment of the form dN/dt=(g(N)+σ(N)ε(t))N, where N=N(t) is the population size at time t. In this general model we have assumed that the per capita growth rate (1/N)dN/dt has an “average” value g(N) and is perturbed by a white noise σ(N)ε(t) describing the effect of environmental fluctuations, where σ(N) is the noise intensity and ε(t) is a standard white noise. This model generalizes the specific models that have been proposed in the literature by several authors, which consider specific functional forms for the “average” growth rate g(N) and for the noise intensity σ(N). Since little is known about the specific functional forms, by considering general functions g(N) and σ(N), subjected only to a few mild assumptions mostly dictated by biological considerations, we aim at obtaining results that are model robust. We review results on “mathematical” extinction and existence of stationary densities. By “mathematical” extinction we mean population size reaching zero or converging to zero as time goes to infinity. Since these models are approximations, it is preferable to talk about “realistic” extinction, by which we mean population size dropping to some low threshold size. We will review previous results by the author and a co-author on the probability of that happening and on the first passage time by the threshold. We also study the time to reach a high threshold size, which may be of importance for the study of pest outbreaks. We give an example of application, including the issues of parameter estimation and prediction. Finally, we briefly consider the extension of these results to harvesting models.}},
